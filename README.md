# Installation
---------------
Installing this theme is pretty easy. After download you should have a karta.zip (compressed file with all folders and files of this theme).

### Installation
You can use WordPress Admin Panel to install this theme or do it manually.
###### WordPress Admin Panel

1. Go to **Appearance > Themes**
2. Click on **Add New**
3. Click on **Upload Theme**
4. Choose the `karta.zip` file
5. Click on **Install Now**

###### Manually ( FTP )

1. Exctract the `karta.zip`
2. Using an FTP client or Control Panel to access your host web server and upload `karta` folder to the `wp-content/themes`


#### Activate the theme
After installation you can click on **Activate** or:

1. Go to **Appearance > Themes**
2. Hover over the **Karta** screenshot and click on **Activate**

# Adapting existing content
---------------
If you already have menus and widgets on the website, you need to do this after finishing the theme activation process:

1. Go to **Appearance > Menus** and update theme locations
2. Go to **Appearance > Widgets** and add old widgets to new sidebars

If you already have uploaded images on the website, you should regenerate thumbnails. To do that you can install [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin.

If you didn't use featured images you can install the [Easy Add Thumbnail](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-add-thumbnail/) plugin to dinamically set featured images for old published posts.


# Customization
---------------
### Customizer
To open WordPress Customizer go to **Appearance > Customize**. There you will find the following sections:

#### Site Identity
Set the site title and tagline, choose what to display in header (logo or site title and tagline). 
Set copyright text which will be displayed in the footer.

#### Menus
Select which custom menu to use on the site.

#### Widgets
Add, modify, reorder and remove widgets in the theme’s designated widget areas.

#### Front
Choose whether to display a static page or your latest posts on the front page.
